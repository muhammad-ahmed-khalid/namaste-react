JSX is not a part of react
we can write react without JSX
JSX is not HTML in JS , jsx is like HTML syntax

// these both are same
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id: "heading"}, "Hello");
// these both are same --- (transpiled) this code converted into a code which browser can understand & transpiled is done by PARCEL----
or parcel yh kaam khud nahi karta hy parcel yeh kaam babel sy karwata hy
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Ao</h1>

js engine will not understand this code: const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Ao</h1>

ES6 this what js is and JS engine will understand this and all its ver and this is understand by your browser


React.createElement => ReactElement-JS object => HTMLElement(render)
JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTMLElement(render)

Babel is converting your jsx code to React.createElement
