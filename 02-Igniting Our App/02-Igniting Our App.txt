NPM:
node package manager is wrong,
npm packages ko manage karta hy but iski full form node package manager nahi hy
package.json is a config for npm
most important package in our project is a bundler
bundler is basically bundle your app before going it to production
agar create-react-app ki bat krien toh yeh behind the scene webpack ko use karti hy
two dep hoti hy
1) dev dep
2) normal dep
dev dep it is req for when we devel our app
but normal dep is use in production also

  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.10.3"
  }

"^2.10.3" ^ yeh jo sign hy isko caret(^) bolty hain ham isko jaga tilde(~) be daal skty hain
caret(^): jab minor upate aye gi 2.10.3 like 2.10.5 toh yeh update krdyga
tilde(~): jab major upate aye gi 2.10.3 like 2.12.3 toh yeh update krdyga

if you have package.json nad package-lock.json then it will regenerate your node_moudles

npx parcel index.html
yeh karay ga yh ky hamray liye local server bana dayga like:  http://localhost:1234

npm ( if you wanna install a package then use npm )
npx means executing our package

dev build
local Server
